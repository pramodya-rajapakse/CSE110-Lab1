# Pramodya Rajapkse
Hi, my name is Pramodya Rajapakse (pronounced *pruh-moe-dee-ya*, although I also go by Prom (like the dance). I am a third-year transfer student majoring in Computer Science. 

## Me as a Programmer
I started programming in my senior year of high school, and although I wasn't entirely sure that I was going to pursue computer science as my major, it was really the only area that I was interested in. Although 4 years feels like a long time, I still like I've only scratched the surface of programming as a whole, but I am excited to keep learning and growing. My time in community college, although productive, felt somewhat scattered, so I'm eager to really start honing in a specific area of computer science.
