# Pramodya Rajapkse
Hi, my name is Pramodya Rajapakse (pronounced *pruh-moe-dee-ya*), although I also go by Prom (like the dance). I am a third-year transfer student majoring in Computer Science.

## Me as a Programmer
I started programming in my senior year of high school, and although I wasn't entirely sure that I was going to pursue computer science as my major, it was really the only area that I was interested in. Although 4 years feels like a long time, I still like I've only scratched the surface of programming as a whole, but I am excited to keep learning and growing. My time in community college, although productive, felt somewhat scattered, so I'm eager to really start honing in a specific area of computer science.
Thus far my experience mainly includes:
- C++/C
- Java
- Python
Although I have done work in other languges (R, SQL), these three are the ones I am most comfortable with. However, I have started to realize that knowing a language is far less important than the underlying principles that you employ on a project.
In terms of web development, I am very much out of practice. I dabbled in it for a short time after high school, but never had the time to commit to an extensive project. 

### CSE-110
I was surprised that the required coursework for Software Engineering was only one class, so I'm sure I will not be industry-ready by the end of this class. However, I do hope this class will demystify the true work and skills that are required of a software engineer, and at least give a taste of what working on a long (relatively speaking) project with a group will be like. As such, my goals for this class are:
- [ ] Become comfortable with the fundamental tools needed for development projects (source control, CLI, project management)
- [ ] Get a sense of where I am lacking in terms of writing and maintaining quality code
- [ ] Get a sense of the challenges and pitfalls that come with coordinating with a group
